# Uncommon MATLAB Function Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in a MATLAB function. The function `myFunction` exhibits unexpected behavior under specific conditions.  The original function contains a potential flaw in handling certain inputs. The solution demonstrates a corrected version with improved error handling and robustness. The files are: 
- bug.m: The original MATLAB code exhibiting the error.
- bugSolution.m: The corrected MATLAB code with the error resolved.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the code. Observe the unexpected behavior or error message.
4. Open `bugSolution.m` and compare. Run the corrected code and observe the improved behavior.
